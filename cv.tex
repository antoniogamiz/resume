I have basic experience in building webapps based on React.js, HTML, CSS. I'm also worked a lot with Typescript and Javascript. I am more intestered in backend development, where I have worked with Node.js, MySQL, Oracle and MongoDB (and Deno, the new NodeJS). I also have a very good understanding of Git, Github and Linux. I have made some minor projects in C++ and Python. I try to follow the principles described in Clean Code and Clean Architecture and TDD. From time to time, I like to write posts about what I do in \href{https://dev.to/antoniogamiz}{DEV.to}.
